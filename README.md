# CRYSTAL_KEMAL

## What is Crystal?
Crystal started out as an experiment to see what compiled Ruby would look like. And now Crystal is a programming language that aims to be friendly for both humans and computers alike - make developers enjoy writing code, and make code run as efficiently as it can. Statically typed, compiled language with a really heavy type inference to make it feel as scripting. 

Crystal compiles down to efficient code, which means Crystal programs are much faster than Ruby programs.

Crystal donâ€™t work on Windows. So you have to use a Mac or a Linux based system.

Use the Crystal extension to provide support for the Crystal programming language.
